    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore opinion mining and sentiment analysis through the use of natural language processing. Our dataset consists of reviews of electronic products scraped form Amazon and available here: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to use the reviews to extract meaningful characteristics about their respective product. Such characteristics can then be used to help the user make faster and more informed decisions when shopping on electronic commerce websites. The extracted characteristics consist of pairs of words that describe a property of the product such as its quality or performance. Those pairs are either of the type adjective-noun or adverb-past participle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Adjective - Nouns: (good, quality) (low, price) (best, deal)\n",
    "    Adverb - Past Participle pairs such as (well, made) (poorly, assembled)\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics can then be categorised into positive and negative opinions and shown to the subsequent potential buyers. This way, users can quickly be informed on the general trends and opinions formulated by previous clients about a particular product. "

    "#### 1. Electronic reviews sample\n",

    "#### 2. Full dataset metadata\n",
    "The metadata was downloaded from the cluster. It is not possible to load it in memory as when uncompressed it is more than 10GB in size. Since we care about electronic products for the moment, we read it line by line and only store the entries whose category is related to electronics. This results in a much smaller file of approx 500Mo (uncompressed) which can hold in memory.\n",

    "We've opted for the data story and the idea is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to put into practice the idea stated in the introduction, namely to complement user feedback on e-commerce platforms. The story would go roughly as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "When visiting the presentation page, the user will be presented with a dummy e-commerce webpage with a product and some reviews. By scrolling down the page, the user will be able to see which collocations of the review are selected by our pipeline and how they contribute to the characterisation of the product. Finally, the user will be presented with a new dummy e-commerce webpage in which he will be able to see the full output of our processing pipeline for a few selected products. That is, characteristics of the product will be shown in addition to review and ratings. The more a characteristic is mentionned by the clients, the more it is emphasized on the webpage."
