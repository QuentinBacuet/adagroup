# Amazon Product Reviews Analysis for Focuse-Oriented Shopping Experience

## Abstract
Other people's opinions tend to make us more **open-minded and critical thinking** when they are more personal and detailed. It is easier for us to **question and relate to** particular stories describing someone's opinion formation rather than general statements. In this project, we aim to test this hypothesis using Amazon product reviews dataset. Our main assumption is that longer reviews tend to be more informative, thus more detailed and personal. This view angle on opinion formation and decision making might be helpful towards reframing online-shopping experience from quite an exhaustive one to more focused and unbiased by (at least) increasing people's awareness about the importance of focused life.

- Are there **critical** reviews with **higher** ratings/**praising** reviews with **lower** rankings?
- To what extent **long** reviews tent to be found **more helpful**?

- What product **categories** tend to contain **more long reviews** (e.g. cheap vs expensive)?
- What product **categories** tend to contain **long reviews** that are found **more helpful** (e.g. cheap vs expensive)?
